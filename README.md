A simple digital synthesizer made in pure data --an open source visual dsp environment created by Miller Puckett-- in 2016.

This synthesizer has a few simple features. It has two separate oscillators each capable of four different standard waveforms:
Sin, Sawtooth, Square and Triangle.

There is a crossfader that allows the user to mix the two synths together.

The pitch of the synthesizer is restricted to a single scale that plays in Ionian Mode (standard major scale) and Dorian Mode
(a minor scale that works well with blues and jazz). The pitch is intended to be adjusted with a knob.

There are also vibrato depth and rate, left and right delay fx and a low pass filter with cutoff and resonance input.

I will add more to this description at a later date.

Feel free to fork this repo and change it in whatever way you want.
